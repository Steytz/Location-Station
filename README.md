# Location-Station

This app is mostly a demo and was made to check out swiftui

In the "Location Station" app, it is possible to display the public transport departures in the vicinity of the user with just a few touches.

**After opening the app, the following data is displayed directly on the integrated map:**

- The current location of the user
- Stops that are in the vicinity of the user (radius x)
- Departure times of the public transport at the stop
- There is also another refresh button that updates the data.
